How to bootstrap this project
----------

```
cd electris
npm install less universal-jst
mkvirtualenv electris
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the project

```
cd www
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Server environment
------------------

The following environment variables must be defined:

* ``DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` ("production" to disable DEBUG mode)
* ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` (for boto)
* ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` (for boto)
* ``AP_USERNAME`` (for FTP)
* ``AP_PASSWORD`` (for FTP)

Polling data
----------------------

From 2012 Associated Press FTP docs:

* Data is updated every 4-6 minutes. (Verified with AP rep.)
* Clients may connect once per minute.
* Clients must disconnect after each request.

Cron jobs:

```
*/2 * * * * cd /home/ubuntu/apps/electris/repository && ../virtualenv/bin/fab production update_ap_data
* * * * * cd /home/ubuntu/apps/electris/repository && ../virtualenv/bin/fab production update_backchannel deploy_local_data backup_electris_db
```

Deploying from the Bitbucket backup repo
----------------------------------------

In the event Github is down, you can deploy from Bitbucket with the following:

```
git push bitbucket master
fab production master deploy:bitbucket
```

You must have had a user configured on Bitbucket for this to work!
